I am a first year PhD in the Operatiosn Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Vivek Farias. Previsouly, I was at the University of British Columbia where I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Sciecne and Mathematics and a M.Sc. in Computer Science. At UBC I worked with Professor Bruce Shepherd on approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems and with Professor Jesse Perla on various problems in computational macroeconomics.
